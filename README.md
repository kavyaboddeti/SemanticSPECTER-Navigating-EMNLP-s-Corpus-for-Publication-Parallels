# SemanticSPECTER

SemanticSPECTER is a powerful tool designed for semantic search within Natural Language Processing (NLP) publications. Leveraging advanced techniques including the Sentence-transformers library and the SPECTER model, SemanticSPECTER enables researchers and enthusiasts to efficiently discover similar publications based on the semantic content.

## Key Features

### Semantic Search Functionality
Utilizing state-of-the-art models, SemanticSPECTER conducts semantic similarity comparisons within a vast corpus of NLP publications, facilitating comprehensive search capabilities.

### EMNLP Publications Corpus
The system is built upon an extensive EMNLP publications corpus spanning the years 2016 to 2018, ensuring a rich dataset for semantic comparison and retrieval.

### Efficient Encoding
Through the use of the AllenAI-SPECTER model and the Sentence-transformers library, SemanticSPECTER efficiently encodes publication titles and abstracts, enabling rapid retrieval of relevant publications.

### Interactive Search Interface
Users can input queries consisting of titles and abstracts, and SemanticSPECTER will return the most similar papers from the EMNLP corpus along with their respective scores, venue, and publication year.

### Sample Searches
The system showcases its proficiency by conducting searches for similar papers presented at EMNLP 2019 and 2020, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying related publications across different conference years.
